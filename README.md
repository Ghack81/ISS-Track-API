# ISS-Track and some use API
Here is an example PHP code that uses the OpenNotify API to get information about the International Space Station (ISS) passes over Paris, France.

Here is a README template for a web page that allows users to test APIs and includes examples such as the International Space Station API. 

This page is currently under development and will provide users with a convenient way to test and explore various APIs. The page will feature sample code and documentation for each API, as well as interactive tools for sending requests and examining responses. 

Stay tuned for updates and additional features as we continue to build and refine this API testing platform.
